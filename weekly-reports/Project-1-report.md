## Project 1 Deliverables
**Working Cell Phone Stand**: Create a functional cell phone stand tailored to your daily life as an MDes student using the Computational Design Cell Phone Stand Rhino Grasshopper Worked Example as a reference.


> I read through TJ's file and modified the size, table height, etc., to tailor it to my daily life usage for standing presentations.

> You might have noticed that the width may not seem to be a perfect fit. This is because I used to have a phone case and left the cap specifically for it. I went through three iterations to find the best working black acrylic phone stand for my needs. Here are more details about [how I made it](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-YuntingZh/blob/main/weekly-reports/Week1_2023_8_30.md#testing-the-black-acrylic-phone-stand) and its real-life use cases.


**Modified Grasshopper+Rhino File**: Customize the baseline Grasshopper+Rhino file to incorporate your unique geometric design. This modification should showcase your ability to reconfigure the Grasshopper file, involving various operations such as boolean operations, subtractions, offsets, etc.


**Custom Design System**: Develop a personalized design system through the Grasshopper file modifications. This system does not necessarily need to result in a cell phone stand but should still be applicable to your life as a student.

> These modifications have been a valuable learning experience, and I believe they reflect my understanding of computational design principles.
