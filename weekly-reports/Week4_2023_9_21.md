## Week 4 TODO
- [x] hello world!
- [x] connect Photon2 Berkeley IoT Wi-Fi
- [WIP] know what's in the box, watching tutorials
## Reflections
I am so happy that starting form this week we are offcially done with grasshopper and have dived into the Particle Photon 2 project. I watched some videos on utilizing photon and [IFTTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_pxTvpzQ0) this week. Although it's my first time using photon 2, I am genuinely looking forward to it! So far, I have set up my photon 2 and also connected to Berkeley IoT Wi-Fi:

## Speculations
I want to continue exploring what can i do with this toolkit, discover some exciting IFTTT projects, and also see what fun games I can create with this toolkit!
