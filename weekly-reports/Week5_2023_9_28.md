This week, I explored more about Photon and had the opportunity to listen to a guest speech from Adrian Freed, the former Research Director of UC Berkeley's Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT). 
I took a pictures of one of the fabrics he showcased.

I found many interesting works on his website, especially an article that discusses the incompatibility between traditional PCB layout styles and eTextile Appliqu√©s. He introduces an layout style that is more suitable for e-textiles.

## Experimenting Photon 2 
In class, I made slight modifications to a part of the code, resulting in an alternating blinking light. [Link to the video](#)

This feature was achieved using a photoresistor. When the brightness exceeds 4000, in my case, the light illuminates. [Link to the video](#)

## Week 4 TODO
- [x] Play around with Photon 2
- [x] Project 2 brainstorm and plan
## Reflections
This week has been particularly enriching. Listening to Adrian Freed brought a lot of insights into the potential of e-textiles, sparking my interest in potentially integrating these materials into future projects. The hands-on experimentation with Photon also reinforced the importance of exploration. It reminded me of the iterative nature of both coding and design and the need to be adaptive and flexible in my approach.

## Speculations
Moving forward, I speculate that e-textiles might become a significant aspect of wearable technology. The blend of traditional textiles with embedded electronics offers a seamless integration that conventional devices can't. Given the rapid advancements in miniaturized electronics and the increased interest in wearables, it's plausible that the next big revolution in wearable tech will heavily involve e-textiles. On the Photon side, I aim to dive deeper into its capabilities, possibly exploring more sensor integrations and creating interactive systems that can react in real-time to environmental changes.
