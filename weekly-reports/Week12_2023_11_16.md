# Weekly Report - Week 12 (As of 11/16/2023)
This week I have been searching around and tryng to assemble my final piece. I would like to do something combined with LLM and gaming elements. My goal is to create something fun and interactive.
I have been also thinking about combining AR into the final project. 
I am curious about using the LLM or GPT model to create my own AI NPC(chatbox) that people can talk to and interact with. 
Here are some tutorials that I found might be able to contribute to my final work:
