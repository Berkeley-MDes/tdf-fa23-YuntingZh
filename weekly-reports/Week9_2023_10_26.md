# Weekly Report - Week 9 (As of 10/26/2023)
## 10/20/23

Last Thursday, we had a review session for all the projects submitted by our peers, which was both enjoyable and inspiring.

Peter Binggeser: Designing Intelligence
Today, we are going to learn about customizing Language Model (LLM). @zeroWidth

Step1:
Pretraining - pass a massive amount of raw text(tokens) through a giant neural network.

Step2:
Fine tuning - Train on structured supervised promp t& response example data.
e.g. hugging face/OpenOrca 

Setp3:
RLHF(Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) - Generate options and select the best one to reinforce the model 
Foundational Model - leveageable 
>"An LLM is a black box that does autocomplete very well"
Now setup ZeroWidth.ai

Consider setting the knowledge set base to contain 300-400 tokens per entry.-> think of the user case what type of text or info, to think about the size of info. Providing information in chunks of 350 tokens per knowledge base entry would be optimal. However, it is anticipated that this topic may become a subject of debate in the coming years.
token counter - under input box 
try out different knowledge set to see the different. 
Before proceeding further, let’s create a welcoming message and inquire about the visitor’s role by asking, 'Who are you?' It’s crucial to establish their identity and preferred communication style before delving into any specific topics.
Please note that the content fed into the system does not need to be in markdown format
