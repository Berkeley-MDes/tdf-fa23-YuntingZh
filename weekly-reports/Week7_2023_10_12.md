# Weekly Report - Week 7 (As of 10/9/2023)

## class note + Recent updates

For our group project, I am exploring sound part with Kirk for the windchimes. Jeff introduced us tone.js: https://tonejs.github.io/
Useful link:
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/tone
I found some tutorials online and started to set it up.

So far I downloaded node.js and import tone library. Now I am using vsCode and live-server to play with it:

import * as Tone from './node_modules/tone/dist/Tone.js';

//sample code from their page
const synth = new Tone.Synth().toDestination();

document.getElementById('playButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
    const now = Tone.now();
    synth.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "8n", now);
    synth.triggerAttackRelease("E4", "8n", now + 0.5);
    synth.triggerAttackRelease("G4", "8n", now + 1);
});
