# Final Project
![research](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-YuntingZh/assets/100269093/be9df314-0168-4eec-8dfb-d7b6ce5f9ddc)

> We initiated this chatbox project to expand upon our Project 3 in the TDF class. By utilizing the API from Zerowidth, we built our own AI chatbox. A significant challenge from our last project was the inability to get image responses from the AI chatbox, so we focused on overcoming that. Additionally, we aimed to strike a balance with the chatbox, making it user-friendly, engaging, yet ensuring the accuracy of the information it provides. This was crucial, as we needed to avoid inaccuracies, especially given the serious nature of our medicinal diet-based chatbox. We researched and integrated a self-curated recipe database, specifically tailored for various health needs. For example, when a user reports a symptom like a stomachache, the chatbox responds with appropriate food recommendations. A lot of effort went into data pre-cleaning, as many traditional Chinese recipes were only in Chinese. We translated these into English and sourced images for each recipe, ensuring they matched the interface style. To guarantee data accuracy, we consulted friends majoring in traditional Chinese medicine to review our database. This meticulous approach helped us set up a reliable and informative AI chatbox.

### Reflection & Speculations 

Our project integrates AI chatbox technology with traditional Chinese medicinal cuisine, significantly enhancing the user experience in several ways. We bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and modern convenience, making traditional health knowledge more accessible to a broader, tech-savvy audience. Our AI chatbox offers personalized dietary recommendations based on user symptoms, providing a tailored experience that aligns with individual health needs.

The addition of a visual component, especially integrating images with chat responses, enriches user interaction, making it more engaging and informative. By translating traditional recipes and pairing them with images, we overcome language and cultural barriers, broadening the appeal and usability of our project.

Moreover, our focus on ensuring the accuracy and relevance of information, particularly by consulting experts in traditional Chinese medicine, adds a layer of trust and credibility to the user experience. This is crucial in fields like healthcare, where misinformation can have serious implications.
